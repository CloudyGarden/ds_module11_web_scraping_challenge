# ds_module11_web_scraping_challenge

In this challenge, I collected, organized, stored, analyzed, and visually graphed data that was collected via web-scraping. I used knowledge of HTML elements to draw information using Splinter and Beautiful Soup.

I used knowledge and resources from class lecture and course materials, and used rmg.co.uk to fact check information.
